📊 School Workforce Planning & Visibility Platform (Stage 1 Pilot)
🧩 Product Overview

The School Workforce Planning & Visibility Platform is a school-facing workforce analytics solution funded by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to improve workforce planning visibility and reduce operational decision delays in secondary schools.

The platform centralises fragmented workforce data across existing systems (HR, payroll, timetable, leave management) into a consolidated reporting layer to enable timely staffing decisions.

This Stage 1 pilot focuses on improving reliever hiring responsiveness and reducing manual reporting burden.

🎯 Problem Statement

Workforce data in schools is currently distributed across multiple independent systems (HR, payroll, timetable, leave), with no central reporting layer or integration capability.

As a result:

Leadership lacks timely visibility of workforce allocation and vacancy duration.

Decisions to hire additional relievers are delayed.

Instructional continuity is disrupted.

Workforce reports require manual consolidation across systems.

The absence of centralised visibility leads to reactive rather than proactive workforce planning.

📉 Current State Challenges
Issue	Operational Impact
Fragmented workforce data	Delayed staffing decisions
No central reporting layer	Manual report preparation
Limited visibility of vacancy duration	Prolonged unfilled roles
No consolidated workload view	Uneven department load
🎯 Business Objectives
Objective 1

Reduce reliever hiring approval turnaround time from 7 days to 3 days to improve instructional continuity and minimise class disruption.

Objective 2

Reduce manual workforce reporting preparation time from 6 hours to 2 hours per month through centralised workforce data visibility.

📊 Key Performance Indicator

Primary KPI:

Reliever Hiring Approval Turnaround Time
Baseline: 7 days
Target: 3 days

Secondary KPI:

Manual Workforce Reporting Preparation Time
Baseline: 6 hours/month
Target: 2 hours/month

🏗 Proposed Solution (Stage 1)

A centralised workforce visibility dashboard that integrates data from:

HR system

Payroll system

Timetable system

Leave management system

The platform will provide:

Vacancy duration tracking

Workforce allocation by department

Reliever request visibility

Automated monthly reporting

The system will function as a reporting and visibility layer only and will not replace operational systems.

🚀 Future Roadmap (Phase 2 – Not in Scope)

Predictive attrition risk modelling

Regional multi-school dashboard

Geographic workforce heatmaps

Automated early-warning staffing alerts
